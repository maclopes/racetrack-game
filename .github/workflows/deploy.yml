steps:
  - name: Checkout repository code
    uses: actions/checkout@v4

  - name: Calculate and Export Version Hash
    # The 'run' keyword executes the subsequent lines in the shell
    run: |
      # 1. Calculate the short hash locally in the shell script
      VERSION_HASH_TEMP=$(echo $GITHUB_SHA | cut -c1-8)
      
      # 2. Export the variable to the GitHub Actions Environment file ($GITHUB_ENV).
      # This makes the variable available to all subsequent steps in this job via ${{ env.VERSION_HASH }}.
      echo "VERSION_HASH=$VERSION_HASH_TEMP" >> $GITHUB_ENV
      
      echo "Version Hash set to $VERSION_HASH_TEMP"

  - name: Deploy using the calculated hash
    run: |
      # The variable is now available as a global environment variable for the job
      echo "Starting deployment for version ${{ env.VERSION_HASH }}"
      
      # Replace this with your actual deployment command, e.g.:
      # docker push my-repo/my-app:${{ env.VERSION_HASH }}
      
      echo "Deployment successful."
